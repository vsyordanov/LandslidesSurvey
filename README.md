## What is LandlidesSurvey?

LandslidesSurvey is a *cross-platform mobile application* that allows users with any level of competence to **map
landslides** on the field in an easy and guided way.

All the collected data are stored in a database through a **publicly open API** that provides endpoints for retrieving,
inserting and modifying the landslides. 

### Features

- Secure authentication method through [Oauth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol.
- User's position always visible on a map.
- Possibility to insert new landslides in the system through a flow of questions (type of hazard, presence of
vegetation, monitoring systems in the area, picture of the landslide, etc.).
- Two different modes: *simple* and *expert*. Users with little to no geological background can use the simple mode to
answer fewer and less detailed questions, while expert mode allows a complete identification and description of the
phenomena.
- Possibility to update or delete mapped landslides.
- Application usable also offline with the possibility to temporarily save the data in the local storage and later sync
them with the main database.


## Technologies

### Client

HTML5, SCSS and JavaScript code wrapped with [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) to create a native,
cross-platform mobile application.

#### Dependencies

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)
- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

### Server

RESTFull API written using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/it/).

### Database

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).


## Installation

### Android

The minimum version required is **Android 7.0 (API level 24)**.

1. Download [LandslidesSurvey-x.x.x.apk](https://github.com/vsyordanov/LandslidesSurvey/releases/download/v1.2.0/LandslidesSurvey-1.2.0.apk).
2. Place the file in your phone.
3. Install the apk.
4. Done!

### iOS

Coming soon...


## Demo

#### Login screen

<img src="https://github.com/epessina/LandslidesSurvey/blob/master/App/screens/01-login.png" width="250" alt="Login screen">

The login screen allows to:
- login into the system;
- navigate to the registration page
- reset the password.

#### Map screen

<img src="https://github.com/epessina/LandslidesSurvey/blob/master/App/screens/04-map.png" width="250" alt="Map screen">

1. **Map**. Centered on the user's position, it can be moved and zoomed freely.
2. **User marker**. Shows the current position of the user. It can be moved if the location is not accurate.
3. **Remote landslide marker**. Shows a mapped landslide that is saved remotely on the main database. A click
on one of those markers opens a screen that shows the information about the correspondent landslide and allows to delete
or modify it.
4. **Local landslide marker**. Works like the remote one but shows a landslide that is saved in the local database.
5. **Settings button**. Opens the application settings.
6. **Sync button**. Transfers on the main database all the landslides saved in the local one. 
7. **GPS button**. Centers the map and the user marker on the current location of the user.
8. **New landslide button**. Opens the screen that allows to insert a new landslide.

---

#### Insert screen

<img src="https://github.com/epessina/LandslidesSurvey/blob/master/App/screens/06-insert-simple.png" width="250" alt="Insert screen">

Simple version of the insert screen. From here the user can insert all the details about a new landslide and save it in
the database.

The only required fields are the landslide type and a photo of the area.

**N.B.** If you insert a landslide in your current location the marker may be covered by the user marker. Just move it to reveal the landslide.


## Technical difficulties

In this section are highlighted some of the technical difficulties which have emerged during the development, together
with the solutions we came up with.


##### Singleton pattern

To make the code more structured, we wanted to create a class for each one of the *Activities* of the application.
To avoid conflicts, however, it was crucial to guarantee that at any time only one instance of a certain Activity was
instantiated.

To solve this problem we have decided to implement the *Singleton pattern* by not using the constructor of the class
directly and defining a public static method that returns the sole instance of the class. In this way, the instantiation
of the class is restricted and only one instance can exist at any time. 

The implementation for a generic Activity is shown below:

```javascript
class Singleton {

    static _instance;

    // The constructor should never be called directly
    constructor(){
        // Initialization of the activity...
    }
   
    static getInstance() {
        if (!Singleton._instance)
            Singleton._instance = new Singleton();
        
        return Singleton._instance;
  	}
  	
}

let first  = new Singleton();
let second = new Singleton();

console.log(first === second); // Output: true
```



##### Photo saved in cache

Cordova by default saves all the photo taken with the camera in the *cache* folder of the application. This is not a
problem if the landslide is uploaded to the server. However, if the entry is saved locally, there is the chance that the
cache is cleaned before the user synchronizes the databases causing an error, since the photo cannot found anymore. 

The solution we came up with consists in moving the photos of the local landslides to the "image" folder in the private
data storage within the application's sandbox. In this way, the photo cannot be deleted by the system and is not
directly accessible by the user.

The method that performs this task is `moveImage(imageUrl)` in `App/www/js/namespace/utils.js`. Here are reported just
the lines that performs the task.

```javascript
window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL(
    imageUrl,
    fileEntry => {
            utils.getLocalDirectory() // Returns the directory in which the file has to be moved
                .then(dir => { fileEntry.moveTo(dir, fileEntry.name, file => onSuccess(file), err => onError(err)) })
                .catch(err => onError(err)) 
    },
    err => onError(err)
);
```


##### Database inconsistency on sign up error  

On the server side an issue we had to face was a possible misbehaviour during the sign up procedure. The steps that the
system performs are the following:

1. validate the data sent by the client;
2. encrypt the password;
3. save the new user into the database;
4. send a confirmation email to the new user's address;
5. send back a successful response.

The problem is that, if an error occurs between point 3 and point 4, we end up with a user saved in the database who
has not received a confirmation email. Therefor, the user cannot login with the account, since it is not confirmed, and
he cannot create a new, since the mail is already registered.

The solution of this problem can be seen in the method `signup` of `Server/controllers/auth.js`. It consists in creating
a temporary variable `newUser` where the newly create user is stored after point 3. Then. the catch block looks like this:

 ```javascript
[...]
    .catch(err => {
       
        [...]
        
        if (!newUser) {
            next(err);
            return;
        }
        
        console.log("User already created. Rolling back...");
        
        User.findByIdAndRemove(newUser._id)
            .then(() => onSuccess())
            .catch(err => onError());
        
    });
 ```
